### Hi there 👋
<img src="./images/Capa.gif"/>

*I'm a 2nd year student pursuing Bachelor's in Engineering from the best public university in Brasil (according to a survey conducted by Brasil's Ministry of Education), Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica - ITA. I'm a passionate learner who's always willing to learn and work across technologies and domains. I love to explore new technologies and leverage them to solve real-life problems. Apart from that I also love to go crazy in hackatons, specially those that I have absolutely no ideia of the main theme. It's just amazing how you can go from nothing to awesome things in a few hours.
